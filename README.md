Rosemary Gladstar's Medicinal Herbs: A Beginner's Guide: 33 Healing Herbs to Know, Grow, and Use by Rosemary Gladstar Book Review

Name: Fierce and Soul
Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Beautifully illustrated with immense knowledge of herbs & their uses...Simple to understand!!!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2016
Review: Sooo.....those weeds you have out in the backyard that are wreaking havoc are actually useful! Nettle even has its uses and me and that weed are definitely NOT friends! Then those bright yellow annoying demons that pop up EVERYWHERE...yup...you can make tea with them. And lets say your hiking and a swarm of mosquitoes attack you...got itchy skin or burning skin? Rip some of that Plantain you see literally everywhere off and apply it to that bite....Yes I've done it and yes it works! You can also make a Plantain salve with uses for burns, bug bites, rashes, minor skin irritations and itchy skin. I'm not new to the holistic health world. I own a ton of essential oils and a ton of herbs and love all the varieties of uses with either one or the other or combining them to make something useful.
This book is perfect for beginners as well as novices. It lists the name of the plant, its uses, safety information, how to harvest and grow it, lots of color pictures and many amazing recipes that are really simple to make. Alot of the other ingredients you can find at your local whole foods store or order everything online. She breaks everything down so its easy to understand. Seriously, this book is perfect for anyone wanting to start using a more holistic approach to their health and well-being. When you look at all the toxic chemicals we eat and breathe, the pesticides we are ingesting, the unnecessary cocktail of medications the pharmaceutical companies shove down our throat and we basically are slaves to society about how to live, eat and take care of ourselves, this book is a welcoming breath of fresh air. It teaches us how to use simple plants and incorporate that into our lives. Even if you just take baby steps and incorporate a few things in the holistic way, your body will thank you for it and so will your pocketbook. Living holistically doesn't have to be expensive.
Yes, there are a gazillion books on natural health, essentials oils, herbs etc but one of the MAIN things you want to look for is the credibility of the author writing it. Too many times I've seen books and e-books, online articles about ways to use essentials oils, herbs, tinctures, lotions, etc, but the dosing is wrong and there is no safety information. Just because its natural does NOT mean its safe!! So do your research, always, always, always!!! Rosemary GladStar is an excellent author and has been working with herbs for years. She also has a few other books as well and I would highly recommend them also!!
Sorry this is long, but I wanted to be able to share a good review. I definitely don't leave good reviews for everything. I'm always honest and up front about the books, items I purchase. I hope my reviews are able to help you make a decision!

Title: Great help with common herbal medicines
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2018
Review: I have already used several of the medicine recipes in this book. My son was sick, so I made the Ginger-Lemonade for him. It's pretty strong tasting, but worked nicely. I also made Lemon Balm tea and it really does help calm you down and helps with sleep. I have the Brain Tincture marinating right now and will try that next month. And also have some Plantain leaves in olive oil marinating in the sun to make it into a salve with beeswax.

Most of the herbs she uses in this book are very common 'weeds' (plantain, burdock, mint, dandelion) and others are sometimes grown just for the flowers, like echinacea. We are so accustomed to getting our drugs at the store, but these common plants have medicinal purposes. If worse comes to worst, you have a veritable apothecary in your neighborhood or local park. And most of the time this medicine is free!

Title: BIG Book Bummer!!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2020
Review: CHECK TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ALL PAGES IN THIS BOOK. BIG PRINTING MISTAKES THROUGHOUT!!! MISSING PAGES AND DUPLICATE PAGES!!!

The book is great however pages 97 thru 128 are missing completely. Pages 65 thru 96 are in 2 sections of book..double print for those pages.....Very disappointing and I wonder if they know that this book is NOT published correctly and how many people have purchased yet haven't actually looked at the pages or noticed this HUGE printing mishap!! Sent back for a refund. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!

Title: A Beautiful Book for Herbal Medicine Making üíö
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2017
Review: Rosemary Gladstar is a renowned herbalist and teacher who's had more than 40 years of experience working with herbs. She is highly respected by herbalists around the world, and she grew up around nature and herbs. Rosemary knows exactly what she's talking about, and I love reading this book and highlighting pertinent information. It's easy to simply read from front to back, it's filled with bright pictures and glowing compassion, and all the basic knowledge you need to begin making your own herbal medicine.

There are plenty of great recipes for natural salves, lotions, teas, tonics, tinctures, herbal remedies, bath products, poultices, liniments, cough syrrups, herbal pills, and more in this book, followed by easy instructions and thorough explanations. Although this book is perfect for beginners, I believe it's useful to have on hand for those who are more experienced herbalists. It's a handy reference book that covers various important medicinal herbs, followed by original recipes for bodycare products and herbal teas.

Rosemary Gladstar is very honest, passionate, and poignant in her writing, readily admitting to her own mistakes and disorganization. I find her openness and creativity endearing; it adds warmth and humanizes this wonderful book. It feels as if she's talking directly to you, helping you make herbal remedies, right at your side. "Rosemary Gladstar's Medicinal Herbs" is a beautiful, informative book that every student of herbalism should own. And if you want to begin your own herbal garden, this is the perfect place to start. She's got your back. üíñ

Title: Repeated sections
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2020
Review: I just opened the book, and began thumbing through it. Either there was a printer‚Äôs mistake or an editor‚Äôs mistake, because the sections on Ginger garlic, sage, thyme and Turmeric repeat.. Even the page numbers are identical despite the distance between the sections. I‚Äôm worried that this means I am missing a couple of sections.
